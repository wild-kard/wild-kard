Full Stack Developer with experience in Python, Javascript (React & Node.js), Wordpress (and PHP for plugins), HTML/CSS, Bitcoin and Liquid. 

I am currently doing freelance work in web design for ecommerce, primarily for companies that wish to implement customized and self hosted BTCPAY payment backends for self clearing and zero fee payments.

If it involves Bitcoin I'm generally interested.
